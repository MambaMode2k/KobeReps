#   Regarding karma checking, my aim is for the new members to rack up some sort of credibility within the community (via karma within this subreddit only),
#   to hopefully lead them to start utilizing the central guide made for beginners first to minimalize spoonfeeding and redundancy.

#   Q: How will users be able to gain karma within this subreddit in order to create a post, if all actions are restricted in the first place for newcomers?
#   A: There will be a restriction only for SUBMISSIONS, but allow users to commment on any existing posts to gain karma in kReps.

#   Main rules that the AutoModerator will manage:

#   1. Accounts must be both older than 2 days and have more than 1 kReps comment karma in making any type of submission. 
#      There will be the exception of comments, where accounts must only need to be more than 2 days old.

#   2. Filtering/deleting & autoreplying to comments that ask stupid questions and to prevent bypassing the filters by asking in a random post thru the comments section.

#   Lets start!

# This will restrict new users in creating any type of post except comments with its respective requirements on age and karma.

  comment_subreddit_karma: < 1
  account_age: < 2 days
